### class - blueprint or template to create object
### object - instance(defining) of a class

### Constructor - special method which initialize values 
construtor name should be className, without return type




### Inheritance
"extends"
acquires properties from one class to another (parent to child)
1. single
2. multilevel - 
A -> B extends A -> C extends B
4. hierarchal - 
A -> B extends A -> C extends A


### Polymorphism
particularly for methods
1. Method overriding - same method name, same no of arguements
2. Method overloading - same method name, diff no of arguments

### Static
created only once in memory
use "static" keyword
how to call: ClassName.variableName;   //not by object
- only static variable can be used inside static method

1. static variable
2. static method
3. static block

instance block  - {}


### Abstraction - hiding implementation
1. Abstract class - 0 to 100%
2. interface -  100%

#### Abstract class - class with abstract methods (also without abstract method)
#### Abstract method - method which have declaration not definition(without body)
- if we extends abstract class, we should implement abstract methods(give body)

#### Inteface - 100% of abstraction
use "implements"
methods are abstract, public
